"Team work contribution: 
@Shuo Wang takes part in strategies function and optimizes the computer cost for 
pall and dloop functions.  
@Yuxin Yang focuses on pall, dloop function and the discription of overview. 
@Yan Chen takes part in pone functionï¼Œrevises strategies function and visualizes
dloop function for n=1:50. 
Proportion of the work for each member is about 1/3. All three members
work together and discuss closely to figure out the project. "  

"Overview:
The whole file is about the prisoner problem -- there are 2*n numbered prisoners
and 2*n boxes, in which are random distributed cards with prisoners' numbers. 
The prisoners one after another opened the boxes to find their numbers. All get
succeed and can be freed only when each of them found his own number with opening
equal to or less than n boxes.
The file gives three strategies that the prisoners may choose, and individual & 
joint probabilities for the prisoners to get freed under each strategy.
In addition, it also calculates the probabilities of the depth of nesting for
strategy 1 and 2."

"Three strategies:
1: the prisoner starts at the box with their number, 
opens it and reads the number on card, then goes to the box with the same 
number with the former card if not the prisoner number.
2: the prisoner starts at a random box that the prisoner chooses, 
opens it and reads the number on card, then goes to the box with the same 
number with the former card if not the prisoner number.
3: the prisoner chooses and opens half amount of box at one time and
see if the prisoner's number is on the card in the boxes."

"Overall common function parameters:
n - half number of prisoners
k - prisoner number 
strategy - tell which strategy to choose
nreps - the number of replicate simulations."

'strageties' function: returns the amount of the boxes the prisoner k opened till
he found his number.

"Comments: strategy 3 shows the best solution, the probability that a single 
prisoner used strategy 3 to find his number is around 50%. Strategy 1 gives 
almost the same probability as strategy 3. Compare to strategy 1 and 3, strategy
2 gives less probability around 40%. Overall, more random choose, fewer 
probability to be succeed "

"Comments: calculation of the probability with strategy 1 gives output around 30%, 
the length of the maximum loops formed will be less than n and so every prisoner 
will be able to find his number, which is same as the probability that a 
uniformly random permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2n. If each prisoner 
picks boxes totally at random(strategy3) or picks boxes randomly at the 
beginning(strategy2), the probability is almost 0 that they will escape. 
The larger n, the smaller the probability that all prisoner will escape. 
More random choose, fewer probability to be succeed"
